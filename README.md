# Mobius-Strip-cpp_OpenGL-

The Mobius strip is an interesting mathematical and topological geometry.
This is an attempt to learn the mathematics and algorithms behind the rendering of the Mobius strip in OpenGL

## 3D Printing of mobius strip
A major advantage of additive manufacturing is that complex topological geometries can be easily manufactured as compared to the traditional manufacturing processes. This excersise was also conducted to check how efficiently and accurately the design printing is carried out.
